# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Description:
This project contains code to the famous **Rock Paper Scissors** game, between a User and Computer. It is implemented using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## Logic:
We create a basic HTML page and add 3 buttons named "_Rock_" "_Paper_" and "Scissors"corresponding to the three choices the user can make.
The computer chooses any one of the 3 choices randomly and based on the choices made by user and computer, the result is displayed below.

## Methods and Properties used:

**_document.getElementbyID()_** : This javascript method is used to find a specefic html element by the id name provided to it.

**_querySelectorAll('')_** : This method is used to find all elements available by using the name of the selector provided to it. Since it is used to find selector it is necessary to add '.' before writing a class name and '#' before writing  an ID name.

**_Math.random()_** : This javascript method is used to generate a random number between 0(inclusive) to 1(exclusive).

**_Math.floor()_** : This javascript method is used to return the floor value of a decimal number.

**_innerHTML_** : The innerHTML is a property of the Element that allows you to get or set the HTML markup contained within the element.
